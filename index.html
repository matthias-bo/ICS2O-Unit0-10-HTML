    <p>Many zoos around the globe have white tigers, and these exhibits can
    certainly attract plenty of attention and lots of visitors.<br> While it
    does happen, breeding these tigers in zoos is frowned upon and many zookeepers
    elect to have the tigers spayed or neutered<br> to prevent breeding from occurring.
    White tiger facts show that in the wild, illegal poaching is all too common, as the
    white coats<br> can fetch a high price on the black market. Whether they are in captivity
    or in the wild, there are many programs in place that serve<br> to protect white tigers from
    illegal hunting or improper living conditions. -facts cheif from www.facts.net</p>
